Social network for tourists

A project that I presented in a SOLACYT contest where I won a bronze medal with a partner.
It's about to help find places for tourists nationals and internationals that is not easily to find a particular place.
There are various features:
- Add your places favorites.
- Near events from a particular place.
- Add friends
- Upload pictures

Technologies used: JAVA, Spring MVC, AJAX, JQUERY, AWS, MySQL.
